Core:
	SqlDatabase:
		-- need better way to add quote marks around strings.
			Look for a way to input them as replacements for '?' in an insert query.
	Search:
		-- ItunesResultConverter -- will it throw exception if parsed json has elements missing?
			-- should return empty list?

UI:
	PodcastListView:
		-- Icon_Outline not sending clicks to button on the transparent inside of it
	ViewModels:
		-- Seperate style used to display a podcast into a seperate file so it can be re-used by different views.
		 Currently copy-pasted in PodcastListView and SearchView
		-- Search
			-- pretty it up
				-- change button to search icon
				-
	NavBarViewModel:
		-- currently pass subsciption list to the navservice as optional params. The NavBar should not be responsible for this. Should 
		ideally be handled by the function registered with the NavService.
